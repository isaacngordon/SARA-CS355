# SARA-CS355: Search And Reporting Application Project

This project is a multi-phase search engine project for CS355 Internet and Web Technologies, taught by Professor Lawrence Tietleman at Queens College.

The project can be viewed <a href="https://venus.cs.qc.cuny.edu/~gois8338/cs355/">here.</a>

## Search Functionalities 

### Dummy Search
As we learn to build a search engine, you can check out a static search page, which demostrates the layout of a search results page styled in this website's CSS stylesheet.

### File Search
As the internet is a colleciton of hyperlinked files across amny machines, it is important for use to learn how to search through the content of files and documents if we are going to build a search engine. Included is a search function that will return results from CSV, JSON, and XML files.

### Google API Search
Google offers a huge suite of application programming interfaces that can be used to accomplish many, many, webtasks without having to write your own functionality.
As we learn how search engines function, we will use the Google Search API to offload some of the hard work.
