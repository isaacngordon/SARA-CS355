# SARA-CS355: Search And Reporting Application Project

This project is a multi-phase search engine project for CS355 Internet and Web Technologies, taught by Professor Lawrence Tietleman at Queens College.

The project can be viewed <a href="https://glacial-springs-27475.herokuapp.com">here.</a>

## Search Functionalities 

### Dummy Search
As we learn to build a search engine, you can check out a static search page, which demostrates the layout of a search results page styled in this website's CSS stylesheet.

### File Search
As the internet is a colleciton of hyperlinked files across amny machines, it is important for use to learn how to search through the content of files and documents if we are going to build a search engine. This engine can search through uploaded files, and return objects relevant to the query, in order of relevncy. Currently supports  CSV, JSON, and XML files. See below for correct formatting.

- <a href="https://github.com/isaacngordon/SARA-CS355/blob/master/public/search-resources/testXML.xml">Example XML File</a>

### Google API Search
Google offers a huge suite of application programming interfaces that can be used to accomplish many, many, webtasks without having to write your own functionality.
As we learn how search engines function, we will use the Google Search API to offload some of the hard work.

### Web Crawler Based Search (Real Search Engine)
A fully native search engine crawls the internet, indexing various webpages and storing certain information about each site.
